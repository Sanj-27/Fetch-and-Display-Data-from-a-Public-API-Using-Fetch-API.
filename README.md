# Fetch-and-Display-Data-from-a-Public-API-Using-Fetch-API.
This project demonstrates how to fetch and display data from a public API using JavaScript Fetch API. The application dynamically retrieves user information and displays it on a webpage in a user-friendly format. It also includes features for error handling and data reloading.

## Features
- Fetches user data from the public API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
- Displays user details such as:
   - Name
  - Email
  - Address (street and city)
- Provides a "Reload Data" button to refetch data.
- Implements robust error handling for failed API requests.
- Includes responsive and modern UI design for clarity and usability.
- Handles edge cases such as:
  - API unavailability.
  - Network errors (e.g., no internet connection).

## Technologies Used
- HTML: Provides the structure for the webpage.
- CSS: Enhances the visual appearance of the webpage.
- JavaScript: Fetches and displays data dynamically, manages user interactions, and handles errors.
